## CHALLENGE STATEMENT

Farmers, particularly those in remote African villages often lack access to essential agricultural information, such as weather forecasts, crop management techniques, market prices, and disease prevention strategies. This lack of information hampers their ability to make informed decisions, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and income.

Why This Project?
Localised Agricultural Information Platform Powerment: Empower local farmers with knowledge, enabling them to make informed decisions, improve crop yields, and increase their income.

Community Building: Foster a sense of community among farmers, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Sustainability: Promote sustainable agricultural practices, leading to environmental conservation and long-term food security.

Low Complexity: While the features listed above may sound complex, with readily available resources and frameworks, a two-member team can develop a basic version of this platform in two weeks, focusing on essential features.

Scalability: If successful, the project can be expanded and improved over time with additional features and outreach.

## RISKS

Technical risk
Data Accuracy and Reliability: The accuracy of weather forecasts, market prices, and agricultural guidelines heavily relies on the data sources. If these sources are not reliable, it can lead to incorrect information being provided to farmers, impacting their decisions and outcomes.

Data Security: Handling sensitive data such as user information and authentication tokens requires robust security measures. If not properly secured, the platform could be vulnerable to data breaches, leading to unauthorised access and misuse of user data.

Scalability: As the user base grows, the system must handle increased traffic and data volume. If the architecture is not designed to scale horizontally or vertically, it may lead to performance issues, slow response times, or system failures.

Integration Challenges: Integrating with external APIs for weather forecasts and market prices can be complex. These APIs might change or become unavailable, leading to integration challenges and potential service disruptions.

User Experience: The platform needs to be user-friendly, especially for users who may not be tech-savvy. If the user interface is not intuitive or if the application is difficult to navigate, users might not effectively utilise the provided information.

Device and Network Limitations: In rural areas, users may have older devices or limited network connectivity. Optimising the platform to work seamlessly on various devices and slow internet connections is crucial for user accessibility.

Maintenance and Support: Ensuring ongoing maintenance and support for the platform is critical. If there is insufficient support or lack of updates, the platform may become outdated, leading to compatibility issues or security vulnerabilities.

### Non-Technical risks

User Adoption and Acceptance: The platform's success depends on user adoption. If farmers are not willing to use the platform or are resistant to change, the project's impact could be significantly diminished. Addressing user education and acceptance is crucial.

Cultural and Social Factors: Understanding the local culture and social dynamics is vital. Cultural factors, traditions, and social norms can affect how the platform is received and utilised. Failure to consider these factors might lead to misunderstandings or rejection of the technology.

Trust and Credibility: Building trust among the users is essential. If the platform provides inaccurate or unreliable information, it can erode the trust of the farmers. Ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and transparency is key to maintaining credibility.

Environmental Factors: Climate change and environmental factors can significantly impact agriculture. Unpredictable weather patterns, natural disasters, or ecological changes can affect crop yields and farming practices. The platform should be adaptable to these changes and provide relevant information and solutions.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Branching and Merging Strategy: GitHub Flow
Branching: Developers create feature branches from the main branch. Each branch focuses on specific tasks or features.

Merging: Pull requests are created when a feature is ready. Code review is conducted, and after approval, changes are merged into the main branch.

Branching Model:
Feature Branches: Each new feature or bug fix gets its own branch, ensuring changes are isolated.

Release Branches: Before deploying to production, a release branch can be created for final testing and bug fixes.

Hotfix Branches: If critical issues arise in production, hotfix branches are created, fixed, and merged back into both main and active release branches.

### Deployment Strategy:

Continuous Deployment (CD): Utilise continuous deployment tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. On every successful merge to the main branch, an automated pipeline runs tests and deploys the application to the staging or production environment.

Populating the App with Data:
Seed Data: Use seed scripts or database migrations to populate the database with initial data. This can include sample products, user accounts, or any other necessary data.
User-Generated Content: For content generated by users, provide easy-to-use interfaces within the app for users to add and manage their content.

### Testing Strategy:

Unit Testing:
Use testing frameworks like Jest (for JavaScript/Node.js) or pytest (for Python) for unit tests.
Write tests for individual functions and components to ensure they work as expected.
Integration Testing:

Test how different components/modules work together.
Use tools like Supertest for API endpoint testing.
End-to-End Testing:

Automated tests that simulate user interactions with the app.
Tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Puppeteer can be used for end-to-end testing.

Static Code Analysis:
Code Reviews:

Manual code reviews are essential for catching issues that automated tests might miss.
Follow best practices and conduct peer code reviews for every pull request.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

Before deployment, involve real users or stakeholders to perform UAT. Their feedback can be invaluable in catching issues from a user's perspective.
Accessibility Testing:

## EXISTING SOLUTIONS

Farmers' App by IFFCO Kisan: IFFCO Kisan is a popular agricultural cooperative in India that offers a mobile app providing farmers with personalised crop-wise information, weather updates, market prices, and expert advice.

M-Farm (Kenya): M-Farm is a web and mobile-based platform in Kenya that provides farmers with market prices, agricultural tips, and a marketplace to sell their produce directly to consumers and markets.

Similarities:
Access to Agricultural Information: All these platforms aim to provide farmers with easy access to essential agricultural information, including weather forecasts, crop management techniques, pest control methods, and market prices. The information is tailored to the specific needs of farmers.

Mobile Accessibility: Many of these platforms are accessible through mobile devices, either as mobile applications or SMS-based services. Given the widespread use of mobile phones even in remote areas, this approach ensures broader reach and accessibility.

Localised Content: The content provided on these platforms is often localised and tailored to specific regions, crops, and languages. Localised content ensures that the information is relevant and applicable to the local farming practices and challenges.

Differences:
Localised AI-driven Recommendations: Implement artificial intelligence algorithms to provide personalised and localised recommendations to farmers. Machine learning can analyse local soil types, weather patterns, and historical data to offer tailored advice on crop selection, planting times, and pest control strategies.

Interactive Voice-Based Interface: Develop an interactive voice-based system that allows farmers to access information via phone calls. This approach caters to users who are not comfortable with text-based interfaces or have limited literacy levels. Voice-based systems can provide weather updates, crop advice, and market prices through interactive voice responses.

Offline Mode with Synchronisation: Create an offline mode for your platform, allowing farmers to access stored information even without an internet connection. Implement synchronisation functionality that updates the platform when the user regains internet access. This ensures farmers can access critical information even in areas with intermittent connectivity.
